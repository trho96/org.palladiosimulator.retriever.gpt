Sure, here is a sample PlantUML component diagram based on the provided information:

```plantuml
@startuml

package "com.example.project" {
  [CustomerService] 
  [OrderService] 
  [ProductService] 
  [PaymentService] 
}

[CustomerService] --> [OrderService] : uses
[OrderService] --> [ProductService] : uses
[OrderService] --> [PaymentService] : uses

@enduml
```

This diagram represents a simple Spring Boot project with four components: `CustomerService`, `OrderService`, `ProductService`, and `PaymentService`. The arrows represent dependencies between these components. For example, `CustomerService` uses `OrderService`, and `OrderService` uses both `ProductService` and `PaymentService`.

Please note that this is a simplified representation. The actual dependencies and interactions between components in your project may be more complex.
