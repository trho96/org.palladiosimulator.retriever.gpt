Sure, here is a sample PlantUML component diagram based on the given information:

```plantuml
@startuml

package "com.example.project" {
  [CustomerService]
  [OrderService]
  [InventoryService]
  [PaymentService]
}

[CustomerService] --> [OrderService]
[OrderService] --> [InventoryService]
[OrderService] --> [PaymentService]
[InventoryService] --> [PaymentService]

@enduml
```

This diagram represents a hypothetical Spring Boot project with four main components: `CustomerService`, `OrderService`, `InventoryService`, and `PaymentService`. These components are all part of the `com.example.project` package.

The arrows represent dependencies between components. For example, `CustomerService` depends on `OrderService`, and `OrderService` depends on both `InventoryService` and `PaymentService`. `InventoryService` also depends on `PaymentService`.

Please note that this is a simplified diagram and a real-life project might have more complex dependencies and components. Also, the actual diagram would depend on the specific details of the classes, their methods, and their dependencies.
